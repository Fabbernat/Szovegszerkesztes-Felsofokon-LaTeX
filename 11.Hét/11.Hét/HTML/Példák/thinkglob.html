<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In a global strategy to improve the overall quality of the websites,
local communities, city hall, city library, school, university, etc.
may be a good first target for punctual evangelism effort. </p>

<h2 id="strategy">A face-to-face approach to web standards education</h2>
<p>It all started when I visited <a
 href="http://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp">my city's website</a>, and had
the pleasant surprise to see the "valid HTML" and "valid CSS" icons
there.</p>
<p>The initial enthusiasm quickly lead me to think how pathetic it was
to be enthusiast just because, for once, I had found a valid webpage
that wasn't owned/written by a <em>geek</em> [<a
 href="file:///home/viragh/LocalAction.html#footnote">note</a>].</p>
<p>Why do geeks validate their webpages? Because they're cool, because
they're good and conscientious web citizens. Of course. But certainly
they did that because they know someone who has a friend who knows
another person that has been at a conference with a speaker who read a
book by someone who once heard about the validator, or read an article.
Or something like that.</p>
<p>The point is, web geeks do validate because someone convinced them
to do so. Of course "web geeks" are easier to convince than "web
designers" (sorry if this sounds pejorative), but there are other ways
to ease the education work than "good will". Starting with proximity.</p>
<p>It's always easier to convince someone when you can discuss with
this person in front of a coffee. Those of us who have tried to explain
"why this is the right way" by sending a 'nice, polite, informative
e-mail with loads of links to comprehensive resources' know that
face-to-face dialog is a more efficient medium for pedagogy than most
remote methods.</p>

<h3 id="peterpan">The web and the Peter Pan complex</h3>
<p>The web has started out of chaos. One of the reasons why the web has
had its early success is that the technologies (not named standards at
the time) were very loose, basically anyone could throw an HTML-ish
page on a server and it would work. Web technologies have matured into
web standards, and the web should follow. The web should grow up.</p>
<p>The problem is, the web doesn't want to grow up, because it's not
funny becoming an adult when everyone remains a child.</p>
<p>When so few (none?) among the "bigger" sites make a proper use of
web technologies, it's not easy convincing people that they should. In
other words, if we want to beat the "I don't care about valid HTML (or
other web standards), no-one does" logic, we need to find a base of
sites that are likely to cooperate, so that we can show them as "good
examples".</p>
<h3 id="target">Finding a proper target</h3>
<p>"Public" sites are a good target, for two reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Proximity : you can actually go see the person in charge of the 
website and offer to help</li>
  <li> Quality constraints : it may sound manichean, but where the
private    sector is driven by marketing (hence the "go to hell, my
customer    base uses IE5/NS4/your-browser-here" typical answer), the
public    sector has some obligations towards quality. A few examples :
 <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">section 508</a> for accessibility
of government-funded websites in the USA,    or the <a
 href="http://www.e-government.govt.nz/docs/web-guidelines-v1/">new-Zealand
web guidelines</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="localinitiative">Starting local initiatives</h3>
<p>There is space for a nice initiative where volunteers would convince
local authorities to improve the quality of their websites, and
possibly helping them to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An annex project would be to author a paper with two parts : advice
for the "evangelist" (like "be friendly - remember : you're here to
help" or "try to find some local data for your argumentation"), and key
information for the "people in charge" in public administrations. </p>
