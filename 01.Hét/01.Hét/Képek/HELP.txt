NAME
       pdftex - PDF output from TeX

SYNOPSIS
       pdftex [options] [&format] [file|\commands]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  the  pdfTeX  typesetter  on file, usually creating file.pdf.  If the file argument has no extension, ".tex"
       will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of pdfTeX commands can be given, the first of  which  must
       start  with a backslash.  With a &format argument pdfTeX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained
       in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead.

       pdfTeX is a version of TeX, with the e-TeX extensions, that can create PDF files as well as DVI files.

       In DVI mode, pdfTeX can be used as a complete replacement for the TeX engine.

       The typical use of pdfTeX is with a pregenerated formats for which PDF output has been enabled.  The pdftex com‐
       mand uses the equivalent of the plain TeX format, and the pdflatex command uses the equivalent of the LaTeX for‐
       mat.  To generate formats, use the -ini switch.
